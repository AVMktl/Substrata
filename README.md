# Systems Engineering & Research Journal
> A technical repository dedicated to the architectural analysis and implementation of foundational research papers in computer science.

## 🔭 Project Scope
This repository documents the process of decomposing complex system designs into functional implementations. The primary focus is on distributed systems, storage engine internals, and high-performance networking primitives.

## 📑 Research Index
| Category | Paper | Implementation Status | Core Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Consensus** | [Raft: In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm](./01-Raft) | 🔴 Research Phase | C# / .NET |
| **Storage** | [LSM-Trees: The Log-Structured Merge-Tree](./02-LSM) | ⚪ Planned | C++ |
| **Compute** | [MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters](./03-MapReduce) | ⚪ Planned | Go |

## 📐 Engineering Principles
* **Primitive Implementation:** Developing core logic without heavy reliance on high-level frameworks to ensure deep architectural understanding.
* **Verification:** Utilizing formal methods or rigorous testing suites to validate safety and liveness properties.
- **Documentation:** Providing technical commentary on design trade-offs and implementation hurdles.

## 🧪 Verification Metrics
- **Consensus Safety:** [Verification method, e.g., TLA+ or Chaos Testing]
- **Storage Efficiency:** [Throughput/Write Amplification analysis]
